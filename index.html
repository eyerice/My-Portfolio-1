            From BYJU's coding classes, I have learned a lot about HTML and CSS.
            <br>
            We've made websites to order pizza, its size changing depending on the device it's used on.
            <br>
            We also made a  game where the main character Cleo has to defeat zombies and jump over blocks.
            <br>
            And we also made a VR experience website where it stores the history of past bookings and allows
            the user to experience the VR games.
